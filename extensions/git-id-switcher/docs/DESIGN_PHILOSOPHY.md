# Karesansui Architecture

*A design philosophy for Git ID Switcher*

---

## Placing Stones

The gardener asks:

"Why is this stone here?"

A stone that cannot answer should not be placed.

This garden called Git ID Switcher faces the same question.

---

## The Core

"Who am I?" — that's what we switch.

Nothing more.

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

It could be written in 100 lines.

That's precisely why we can spend everything else on *how* to place it.

---

## The Stone

Immovable. The center of the garden.

Create a profile. Select it. Write to git config.

This is the stone. Everything else exists to make this stone shine.

---

## Sand Patterns

Ripples raked around the stone.

Not the stone itself, but what makes the stone a stone.

90% test coverage. Structured logging. Timeout handling. Input validation.

Sand patterns go unnoticed. But a garden without them is just barren land.

---

## Accents

Small presences that give the garden its story.

26 language support. Icons. SSH/GPG key association.

The garden could exist without them. But with accents, the garden becomes *someone's* garden.

---

## Stones We Don't Place

The most important decision is what *not* to place.

GitHub API integration. Token management. Authentication wizards.

They might be convenient. But the moment you place them, it becomes a different garden.

The essence of karesansui lies in *empty space*.

---

## On Over-Engineering

"That's excessive," they say.

They're right.

But no one questions ROI in a hobby garden.

Lining up coverage badges is like hanging a scroll. They're there because they're beautiful.

---

## Origin

2003\. CSS Zen Garden.

The same HTML held infinite styles.

Freedom exists within constraints.

What I learned in that garden became the seed of this one.

---

## Coda

Git ID Switcher is art wearing the mask of open source.

To users, it functions as a tool.
To the maker, it exists as a garden.

Both are true. Both are real.

And so the gardener is satisfied.
