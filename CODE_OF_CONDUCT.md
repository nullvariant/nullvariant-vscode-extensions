# Garden Etiquette

This repository is a karesansui--a garden that expresses the universe through sand and stone.

> For the full philosophy, see [Karesansui Architecture](extensions/git-id-switcher/docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md)

## Principles

*In karesansui: the stone is core function, sand patterns are invisible quality, accents are delightful details.*

**Discern the stone** -- Question the essence; do not place a stone that cannot answer

**Rake every sand pattern** -- Invest time in invisible quality

**Appreciate accents** -- Welcome beauty that seems "wasteful"

**Protect empty space** -- Not placing is also a decision

---

## Welcome in This Garden

- Thoughtful dialogue
- Beautiful code
- Respect for "excessive" quality

---

## Not Welcome in This Garden

Beyond disruptive behavior (harassment, trolling, personal attacks), the following values do not belong here:

- **"If it works, it's fine"** -- A stone does not shine by merely functioning
- **"Quick profit"** -- No one questions ROI in a hobby garden
- **"Eliminate waste"** -- In this garden, sand patterns and accents are not waste

What the world considers right may not be welcome here.
